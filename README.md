## visit [SCS](https://singhconsultancy-gyjf.onrender.com/).

## Introduction
Rendor.com is a platform that allows for easy deployment of web applications. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to deploy a Flask web application on Rendor.com. For demonstration purposes, you can view the deployed application [here](https://www.example.com).

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Flask web development.
- An account on Rendor.com.
- A Flask application ready for deployment.

## Steps

1. **Prepare your Flask Application**: Ensure that your Flask application is properly configured and runs locally.

2. **Create a `requirements.txt` file**: Rendor.com uses this file to install necessary dependencies. Create one in your project directory using the following command:
    ```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Initialize Git repository**: If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory:
    ```
    git init
    ```

4. **Create a Procfile**: Rendor.com uses a Procfile to determine how to run your application. Create a file named `Procfile` in your project directory and add the following line:
    ```
    web: python app.py
    ```

5. **Commit your changes**: Add all files to your Git repository and commit the changes:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

6. **Deploy to Rendor.com**: Log in to your Rendor.com account and follow the instructions to create a new deployment. You'll need to connect your Git repository and specify the branch to deploy from. Rendor.com will automatically detect your Flask application and start the deployment process.

7. **Configure Environment Variables**: If your Flask application uses environment variables, make sure to configure them in the Rendor.com dashboard under the settings for your deployed application.

8. **Monitor Deployment**: Once the deployment process starts, you can monitor the progress from the Rendor.com dashboard. Once completed, Rendor.com will provide you with a URL where your application is accessible.

9. **Test Your Application**: Visit the provided URL to ensure that your Flask application is running as expected.

10. **Custom Domain (Optional)**: If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the Rendor.com dashboard to point to your deployed application.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your Flask web application on Rendor.com. Your application is now accessible to users over the internet.
